maybe change the scraping so that we look for data-source
then look at id prefix

works, but need to store data-source string and id string (already have)

now we dont need function get_champ_name_from_url()

Kogmaw (id is KogMaw)
LeBlanc (id is Leblanc)
Nilah (occupation)
Reksai (id is RekSai)
Rell (position)
RenataGlasc (id is Renata)
Seraphine (position)
Skarner (occupation)
Wukong (id is MonkeyKing)
Yone (position)
